    <string name="askforhelp1">There was a lot of noise from my neighbour\'s house last week. When I went there and knocked,
   there was a sudden silence altogether. She came out and tried to put a brave face but I could
   see that she had wept. I am almost confident that domestic violence is inflicted upon her, but
   she doesn\'t cooperate. How can I help?</string>

    <string name="askforhelp2">I got married 2 months back and since the first day the behaviour of my in-laws has been
   totally unacceptable. They keep taunting me the whole day for petty things bringing the issue
   of money in between. But they don\'t say what exactly they want. What should I do?
